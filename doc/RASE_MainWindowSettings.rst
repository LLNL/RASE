RASE Main Window and Settings
*****************************


The RASE main window appears when the executable is launched, and is depicted in the figure below.

Prior to executing the RASE workflow, the user is encouraged to define a custom work directory where the RASE-generated
data (sampled spectra, replay tool outputs, and analysis reports) will be located. The work directory can be defined
using the “Preferences” dialog accessible through the “Setup” menu. The default location of data for Windows machines
is ``C:\Windows\Users\[UserName]\Rase Data``

The RASE work directory can be accessed at any time from the RASE main window by clicking on the “Sample Spectra Dir”
button in the bottom-right corner.

Additional settings available in the “Preferences” dialog include the choice of the sampling algorithm and the current
correspondence table. These can be accessed and modified at any stage of the analysis workflow.

Additional options in the “Setup” menu include Replay Tool and the Correspondence Table management. These can be accessed
and modified at any stage of the analysis workflow.

The main window provides access to the instrument and scenario definitions. Once these are defined, the steps of the RASE workflow are executed using buttons in the bottom-right "Actions" area.

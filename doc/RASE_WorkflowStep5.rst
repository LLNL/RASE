***********************************************************************
RASE Workflow Step 5: Execute the Replay Tool and the Result Translator
***********************************************************************


Once the replay tool is defined for the instrument and the sampled spectra have been generated for a scenario, highlighting both the instrument and at least one scenario in the main RASE window makes the “Run Replay Tool” button available to the user.

The “Run Replay Tool” button executes the replay tool and creates a sub-directory with the identification report files for each sampled spectrum. This directory will also contain the terminal output of the replay tool, useful for troubleshooting. If the replay tool is not command line-based, the external replay tool software will be initialized and the user must interact with the external tool (often by way of manually specifying sample spectra files to be processed). If the processed files from the external replay tool are not output directly into the replay folder generated by RASE, the the files can be imported back into RASE using the “Import Results...” button.

The “Run Result Translator” button is only accessible via the "Advanced Actions" tab. Most detectors do not require a separate translator, but if a translator is required the translation step is automatically run along with the replay step in the standard RASE workflow. Running the translator automatically (in the standard RASE workflow) or manually (in the advanced actions) creates a third sub-directory with the identification report files in a format compatible with the RASE code.

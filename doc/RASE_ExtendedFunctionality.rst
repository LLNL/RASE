RASE Additional Options and Functionality
*****************************************

The correspondence table describes which isotope identification results count as success or failure for a given scenario.
It is used to score the results of the replay tool. For example, if one isotope in the scenario is considered background
and does not need to be identified for a test to be successful, or if an identification result of “HEU/LEU” is considered a success for
a test on HEU, the correspondence table must be edited to reflect these choices.

The correspondence table can be managed using the dedicated window accessible under the “Setup” menu. This window allows
for manual input of table entries, as well as enables importing and exporting the table in a comma-separated \*.csv
format. \*.csv files can also be edited in Microsoft Excel program independently from the RASE software.

The color-coding of the alphanumeric scenario IDs in the RASE main window corresponds to different stages of the RASE
workflow. It is activated when an instrument is selected:

*  Black: the  scenario was defined, but sample spectra have not yet been generated.

*  Orange: Sample spectra have been generated for this instrument and scenario combination. Replay tool has not been yet executed.

*  Green: The replay tool has been successfully executed for this instrument and scenario combination.

All spectra generated by the RASE software, including the outputs of translators are tested to be compatible with PeakEasy version 4.91. This is the recommended way to review the data produced at any stage of the RASE workflow.

Dynamic RASE - Dynamic Replicative Assessment of Spectroscopic Equipment
========================================================================

RASE is a software for evaluating the performance of radiation detectors and isotope identification algorithms.
It uses a semi-empirical approach to rapidly generate synthetic spectra and inject into detectorâ€™s software
to obtain nuclide identification response.

Dynamic RASE takes these capabilities and applies them in dynamic scenarios, where the sources and detectors 
are in relative motion.

For more information on RASE see:

Required Libraries for Dynamic RASE
-----------------------------------
* declxml
* SQLAlchemy
* Matplotlib, Numpy
* sklearn
* scipy
* pandas
* tqdm
* Mako


Creating a standalone executable for Dynamic RASE
-------------------------------------------------
[PyInstaller](http://www.pyinstaller.org/) can be used to generate a standalone executable for distribution on Windows
operating systems.

Note that PyInstaller is rather sensitive to the overall python configuration. These instructions assume a clean
python environment with the minimal set of python packages installed. We recommend starting with a clean empty python environment 
(e.g. using WinPythonZero)

* Install pyinstaller and pypiwin32 packages via `pip install pyinstaller pypiwin32`
* The file `drase.spec` contains the specifications to create a single executable file `dist\dynamic_rase.exe`.
* Run `pyinstaller -a -y drase.spec`  or `python create_dynamic_distributable.py` from the RASE base folder


Generating documentation with Sphinx
------------------------------------
Dynamic RASE documentation is maintained using [Sphinx](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/).
The documentation resides in the `doc` folder.

Install Sphinx from PyPi using
`$ pip install Sphinx`

<!-- For referencing figures by number it is required to install the numfig extension for Sphinx. -->
<!-- Installation is performed with the following steps: -->
<!-- 1. Download and untar the file at this [link](https://sourceforge.net/projects/numfig/files/Releases/sphinx_numfig-r13.tgz/download) -->
<!-- 1. Run `2to3 -w setup.py` -->
<!-- 1. Run `python setup.py install` -->

To update the documentation:
1. `cd $RASE\doc\dynamic_doc`, where `$RASE` is RASE base folder where rase.pyw lives
1. `make html` to generate html docs
1. `make latexpdf` to generate latex docs and immediately compile the pdf

The documentation is generated in the `doc\dynamic_doc\_build\` folder

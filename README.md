RASE - Replicative Assessment of Spectroscopic Equipment
========================================================

RASE is a software for evaluating the performance of radiation detectors and isotope identification algorithms.
It uses a semi-empirical approach to rapidly generate synthetic spectra and inject into detectorâ€™s software
to obtain nuclide identification response.

For more information on RASE see:
* [R. Arlt et al, IEEE NSS Conf Record, 2009](https://doi.org/10.1109/NSSMIC.2009.5402448)


Required Libraries
----------------------------------
* QT5
* PyQt5 and PyQTWebEngine
* declxml
* SQLAlchemy
* Matplotlib, Numpy, Pandas, Seaborn
* Uncertainties, LmFit
* Mako


Creating a standalone executable
--------------------------------
[PyInstaller](http://www.pyinstaller.org/) can be used to generate a standalone executable for distribution on Windows
operating systems.

Note that PyInstaller is rather sensitive to the overall python configuration. These instructions assume a clean
python environment with the minimal set of python packages installed. We recommend starting with a clean empty python environment 
(e.g. using WinPythonZero)

* Install pyinstaller and pypiwin32 packages via `pip install pyinstaller pypiwin32`
* The file `rase.spec` contains the specifications to create a single executable file `dist\rase.exe`.
* Run `pyinstaller -a -y rase.spec`  or `python create_distributable.py` from the RASE base folder


Generating documentation with Sphinx
------------------------------------
RASE documentation is maintained using [Sphinx](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/).
The documentation resides in the `doc` folder.

Install Sphinx from PyPi using
`$ pip install Sphinx`

<!-- For referencing figures by number it is required to install the numfig extension for Sphinx. -->
<!-- Installation is performed with the following steps: -->
<!-- 1. Download and untar the file at this [link](https://sourceforge.net/projects/numfig/files/Releases/sphinx_numfig-r13.tgz/download) -->
<!-- 1. Run `2to3 -w setup.py` -->
<!-- 1. Run `python setup.py install` -->

To update the documentation:
1. `cd $RASE\doc`, where `$RASE` is RASE base folder where rase.pyw lives
1. `make html` to generate html docs
1. `make latexpdf` to generate latex docs and immediately compile the pdf

The documentation is generated in the `doc\_build\` folder
